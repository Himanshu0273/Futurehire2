## Introduction
Welcome to the FutureHire! This Flutter application is designed to [briefly describe the purpose of your app]. This README will guide you through setting up Flutter, running the app in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and using an emulator.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Flutter SDK**: You can download it from [Flutter's official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Download from [VS Code's official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Dart SDK**: This is included with Flutter SDK, so no separate installation is needed.

### Install Flutter SDK

1. **Download**: Go to [Flutter's installation page](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and download the SDK for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
2. **Extract the ZIP file**: Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location, e.g., `C:\flutter` (Windows) or `~/flutter` (macOS/Linux).
3. **Add Flutter to Path**:
   - For **Windows**:
     - Open the Start Search, type `env`, and select **Edit the system environment variables**.
     - In the **System Properties** window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.
     - Under **System variables**, find the `Path` variable, select it, and click **Edit**.
     - Click **New** and add the path to the `bin` directory inside the Flutter folder (e.g., `C:\flutter\bin`).
   - For **macOS/Linux**:
     - Open a terminal and run:
       ```bash
       export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
       ```
     - You may want to add this line to your shell's startup file (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`) for permanent access.

4. **Run Flutter Doctor**: Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```
   This command checks your Flutter installation and provides instructions to resolve any issues.

## Setting Up Visual Studio Code

1. **Install VS Code**: If you haven't already, download and install VS Code from [VS Code's official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Install Flutter and Dart Extensions**:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "Flutter" and install the **Flutter** extension by Dart Code.
   - Install the **Dart** extension as well (it might be installed automatically with the Flutter extension).

## Setting Up an Emulator

1. **Install Android Studio**: Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. **Install the Android Emulator**:
   - Open Android Studio.
   - Go to **Configure > AVD Manager**.
   - Click **Create Virtual Device**.
   - Select a device definition (e.g., Pixel 4) and click **Next**.
   - Choose a system image (e.g., a version of Android) and click **Next**.
   - Give your emulator a name and click **Finish**.

3. **Start the Emulator**: You can start the emulator from Android Studioâ€™s AVD Manager or from the terminal by running:
   ```bash
   flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
   ```

## Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
   Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Before running the app, ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
   This command fetches all the dependencies listed in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

3. **Run the App**:
   - To run the app, ensure the emulator is started, then use:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   This command will build the app and launch it in the emulator.

## Troubleshooting

- **If you encounter issues with dependencies**: Run `flutter clean` to clear the build cache, then run `flutter pub get` again.
- **Hot Reload**: While the app is running, you can make changes and press `r` in the terminal to hot reload the app, which will apply your changes instantly.

## Conclusion

You are now set up to run the Flutter application! If you have any questions or issues, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
